# G4Hunter

G4Hunter [1][2] is a powerful and widely used tool for G4 prediction which takes into account G-richness and G-skewness of a DNA or
RNA sequence and provides a quadruplex propensity score. G4Hunter is written in R programming language. The source code is
available at https://github.com/LacroixLaurent/G4HunterPaperGit.

Running G4Hunter requires installation of a specific version of R, and specific versions of several R packages as depenecies. These
steps take some time and are different for different operating systems. In this project, we Dockerize G4Hunter to avoid repeating
these configuration steps everytime a user wants to run G4Hunter. A text file called a Dockerfile is used to specify all the
configuration steps. A Docker engine creates a Docker image from the Dockerfile. Docker engine runs containers created off of the
docker image. Container technologies such as Docker also offer other benefits such as portability, performance, agility, isolation,
and scalability [3].

In order to run the Dockerized version of G4Hunter, you need to have the Docker engine installed on your box. Please refer to
instructions at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/. You also need the G4Hunter Docker image. You can either get the G4Hunter
Docker image from Docker Hub, or you can build the image locally. If you are getting the image from the Docker Hub (preferred),
you can skip the instructions for building/pushing the image, and go to the instructions for running G4Hunter Docker container.

# Getting the G4Hunter Docker Image

To pull the G4Hunter Docker image from the Docker Hub repository:
> docker pull kxk302/g4hunter:1.0.0

To view the pulled image:
> docker images -f "reference=kxk302/g4hunter:1.0.0"

# Building/Pushing the G4Hunter Docker Image

All the commands are run in the same directory, say, /Users/kxk302/workspace/

Clone G4Hunter_Docker repository (This creates a folder called G4Hunter_Docker):
> git clone https://github.com/kxk302/G4Hunter_Docker.git

Change your directory to G4Hunter_Docker folder:
> cd ./G4Hunter_Docker

To create a Docker image:
> docker build --progress=plain -t kxk302/g4hunter:1.0.0 .

To view the created image:
> docker images -f "reference=kxk302/g4hunter:1.0.0"

To push the created image to your Docker Hub repository (You need to be regsitered at https://hub.docker.com/):
> docker login\
> docker push kxk302/g4hunter:1.0.0

# Running the G4Hunter Docker Container

You can run G4Hunter on any genome specified in BSgenome package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/BSgenome.html). To get a list available genomes, run the following command in an R environment:

> install.packages('BiocManager')\
> BiocManager::install('BSgenome')\
> BSgenome::available.genomes()

In case the genome is not specified in BSgenome package, you can create your own BSgenome package by following the instructions here: http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/BSgenome/inst/doc/BSgenomeForge.pdf. The outcome of this step is a tar file that you must pass to G4Hunter. For example, suppose you created a BSgenome package for chimpanzee and the tar file is located at '/Users/kxk302/workspace/G4Hunter_Docker/genomes/BSgenome.Ptroglodytes.NCBI.T2TXYv11.tar'.

Suppose you want G4Hunter to save the output file at '/Users/kxk302/workspace/G4Hunter_Docker/output/g4_out.txt'. The output file
name is 'g4_out.txt', the output file folder is '/Users/kxk302/workspace/G4Hunter_Docker/output/', and absolute path
to output file name is '/Users/kxk302/workspace/G4Hunter_Docker/output/g4_out.txt'.

Besides genome and output file, g4hunter accepts window size, chromosome number, and the threshold as input parameters.

On Unix/Mac OS, to run the containerized version of G4Hunter, run the following command:
> ./scripts/run_g4hunter.sh Genome OutputFileAbsolutePath WindowSize ChromosomeNumber Threshold

For example:

> ./scripts/run_g4hunter.sh BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 /Users/kxk302/workspace/G4Hunter_Docker/output/g4_out.txt 25 1 1.5

On Windows, to run the containerized version of G4Hunter, run the following command:

> docker run -v OutputFileFolder:/output kxk302/g4hunter:1.0.0 Genome /output/OutputFileName WindowSize ChromosomeNumber Threshold

Below is an actual invocation of Dockerzed G4Hunter:

> docker run -v /Users/kxk302/workspace/G4Hunter_Docker/output:/output kxk302/g4hunter:1.0.0 BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19 /output/g4_out.txt 25 1 1.5

The -v flag simply mounts a folder on your host machine to the container, to make your local files accessible to the container.

If you were to run G4Hunter for a genome NOT specified in BSgenome package, you need to pass your BSgenome's tar file as the second argument to G4Hunter.

On Unix/Mac OS, to run the containerized version of G4Hunter for a genome NOT specified in BSgenome package, run the following command:
> ./scripts/run_g4hunter.sh BSgenomeTarFileAbsolutePath OutputFileAbsolutePath WindowSize ChromosomeNumber Threshold

For example:

> ./scripts/run_g4hunter.sh /Users/kxk302/workspace/G4Hunter_Docker/genomes/BSgenome.Ptroglodytes.NCBI.T2TXYv11.tar /Users/kxk302/workspace/G4Hunter_Docker/output/g4_out.txt 25 1 1.5

On Windows, to run the containerized version of G4Hunter for a genome NOT specified in BSgenome package, run the following command:

> docker run -v OutputFileFolder:/output -v GenomeTarFilePath:/GenomeTarFileName kxk302/g4hunter:1.0.0 GenomeTarFileName /output/OutputFileName WindowSize ChromosomeNumber Threshold

Below is an actual invocation of Dockerzed G4Hunter:

> docker run -v /Users/kxk302/workspace/G4Hunter_Docker/output:/output -v /Users/kxk302/workspace/G4Hunter_Docker/genomes/BSgenome.Ptroglodytes.NCBI.T2TXYv11.tar:/BSgenome.Ptroglodytes.NCBI.T2TXYv11.tar kxk302/g4hunter:1.0.0 BSgenome.Ptroglodytes.NCBI.T2TXYv11.tar /output/g4_out.txt 25 1 1.5
